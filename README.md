# Overview
The increasing development of the industrial sector necessitates thorough oversight of power consumption, and consumption forecast is the most significant aspect for both energy management
and environmental protection. This work focuses on forecasting power consumption using a stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with convolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture.
